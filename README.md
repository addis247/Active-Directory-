<h1>Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the deployment and setup of Active Directory using Windows 11 and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines. Feel free to try it for yourself at no cost since <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account">Microsoft Azure</a> can be used with a free subscription for 30 days and/or $200 worth of credits. Lets do it! <br />

<h2>üíª Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11 Pro
- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Windows Server 2022

<h2>üß∞ Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

***Assuming you have a Microsoft Azure account already setup, we will first need to create a Resource Group, Virtual Network and Subnet, and the Domain Controller VM using Windows Server 2022. I will name it DC1 and create the username: labuser and password: Password1234 just to keep things simple.***

- In Microsoft Azure, type "resource" in the search bar at the top and click on "Resource groups"
- Click the "Create" button either towards top left or the blue one in the middle of the screen.
- I'll name it "ActiveDirectoryLab" and click "Create + Review" -> then click "Create"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c083bab4-c009-4e2d-b7d6-5131e22c92d6)

**Next, we'll create our virtual network.**

- Type "v" or "virtual network" in the search bar up top and click on "Virtual networks".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae4c47f4-f1fb-4410-9bb0-31a6d73b2acb)

- Click "create" (just like we did with the resource group).
- Make sure it shows the resource group there, if not click the drop down and select it.
- I'll name the VN (Virtual Network) "ActiveDirectory-VNet". ***(Take note of the region and make sure any Virtual Machines we wind up creating are in that same region.)***
- Click Review + Create and then Create.
- Wait for deployment to complete.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c15aa17c-293e-4f9a-9275-8d231dfa3981)

- Once the VN has been created, type "v" or "virtual machine" in the search bar at the top and click on "Virtual machines"
- Click on "Create" -> Azure Virtual Machine
- Make sure the resource group is the one we created.
- I'll call this VM "DC1".
- Make sure its in the same region as the VN.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40d96467-cfd4-4139-a772-f6870975f944)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1514b29b-775b-4903-8542-831a25a7096d)

- For *Image use "Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition - x64 Gen2"
- For *Size use Standard_D2s_v3 - 2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory    

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8485d598-97a2-44d8-ad8e-70f843eadbe4)

- I used username: labuser and password: Password1234
- Once you create your username and password for DC1, click "Next:Disks>" at the bottom and then "Next:Networking>" (the same button)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/850fe8b2-27e9-4218-9be1-1d2d2f429a1d)

- Make sure in the Networking tab, it shows the Virtual network we created selected. ***(Sometimes it won't be there which means you need to wait a bit longer before being able to create the Domain Controller VM. In that case just click "home" in the top left and try again until you see the VN show up as an option.)***
- Then click on "Review + Create" -> "Create".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f19b846-17c2-4885-85e8-8f07a6de5aff)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05fd4ba4-3035-4a4b-8d6f-1cacd4448172)

**Now we need to set the Domain Controller's Network Interface Card's (NIC) to be static instead of dynamic. Then we'll log into the DC1 VM in using Remote Desktop Connection and disable the Windows Firewall.**

- Click "Home" in the top left -> Virtual machine OR type "v" in the search box up top and click "Virtual machine"
- Click on the DC1 VM in the Virtual Machine screen within Azure.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceb3c5af-d283-4016-adfd-1fd5c4f9286c)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03bef0ff-deb1-4b9d-aa49-764348309092)

- Log into the Domain Controller using the Username and Password we created earlier when deploying DC1. (You may need to click on "More choices" on the bottom to change it from the prepopulated username.)
- (Decline any options it presents to you once logged into the Domain.) In the "Search" text box located in the bottom left on the taskbar, type "firewall" and open up Windows Defender Firewall.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd3e60b3-666c-431f-a1e3-3f6c6463f188)

- Click on "Windows Defender Firewall Properties"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bc94ea6-3551-4d81-a893-cee1a0932245)

- Across all three of the underlined tabs (Domain Profile, Private Profile, and Public Profile), change the "Firewall state" to Off
- Click "Apply" in the bottom right after all three have been turned off
- Then click "Ok" and close Windows Defender Firewall

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8d9e957-3935-4761-8f25-fa6bb2de073f)

**Next we well need to create the Client VM in Azure (Scroll up to find the steps on where to click to create a VM if you need to see those screenshots again.)**

- Minimize the DC1 VM and go back to Microsoft Azure
- Click on "Virtual machine" under recents on the home screen OR type "v" in the search box up top and click "Virtual machine"
- Click Create -> Azure Virtual Machine
- I will name it "Client1"
- Use Windows 10 Pro 22H2 for *Image
- Use 2 vcpus 8GiB Memory for *Size
- I will set Username: labuser  and  Password: Password1234
- ***Make sure it is in the same region and Virtual Network as DC1***
- Check the Licensing box
- Click "Next: Disks >" and then "Next: Networking >"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00c47443-fce3-47f9-a242-6d156b3c047d)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df49fe0e-1a71-4fd2-8972-bcd740623c31)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f3018b-5d02-44fe-93f5-928adcd50a65)

- After verifying the VN is the same one we created for DC1, click "Review + Create" and then "Create"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43f6a90d-d6a1-44cf-92e1-c2f8d362ab2a)

**Now we need to set Client1's DNS settings to DC1's Private IP Address. Then, we will ping the Domain Controller to test the connection.**

- After Client1 has been successfully deployed, click on Client1 and go to "Network Settings"
- Click on the Network Interface/IP Configuration (client1559_z1 (primaty)/ ipconfig1 (primary)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f5700f9-a6b3-4bd1-9689-717143363297)

- Click on "DNS servers" in the left side panel under the "Settings" drop down
- Change the DNS servers from "Inherit from virtual network" to "Custom"
- Type the Private IP address for DC1 in the text box (If you need to see how to find the private IP address for DC1, please scroll back up to find and review the steps.)

*And that completes this tutorial, but it doesn't end here! The next tutorial will walk you through and demonstrate how to implement group policy. If you are ready to hang it up for good, I highly reccomend deleting the resource groups in Microsoft Azure to save yourself some money, or at least stop the Virtual Machines if you plan to take a break. If you'd like to learn how to create and deploy Password Lockout Policies and Company Wallpaper, or even just want some exposure to Active Directory Group Policy in general, you are welcome to join me in the next one. See you there! : )*
